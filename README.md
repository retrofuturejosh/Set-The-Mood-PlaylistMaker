# VIBEZ

"Where words fail, music speaks"

Vibez is an in-browser app designed to help users set the perfect vibe for any moment, event, or emotion.

With Vibez, users are first prompted to pick a song that best fits their desired vibe. Utilizing Last.FM's API, users are then able to choose tags that describe the mood they are looking to set. After removing unwanted tags and setting characteristics that best describe an ideal vibe, the playlist creator makes a series of API calls to Last.FM and builds a pool of possible playlist matches. These potential options are then ranked by how many tags match the user's pool of chosen tags. Tags that match the 'most desired' characteristics are ranked highest. After ranking the possible songs and removing duplicates, the user is given a YouTube playlist of music and music videos.

One of the best features of this app is that it requires no log-in and can run on any browser. It is ideal for users who need to create a playlist on a public source without having to provide any sensitive information like an email or password.

...plus it's FREE!

Enjoy and VIBE!
